(Link & AI analysis)

The weekly poll results and early pre-order data suggest that Apple's launch of the iPhone 16 series, particularly the Pro models, is off to a rocky start. Despite some positive aspects of the new models, several factors seem to be contributing to consumer hesitation and a shift in interest toward alternatives.

### Key Points from the Poll:
1. **Pro Models Struggling**: The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models are underperforming in pre-orders, which is surprising given the historical popularity of Pro models. A significant portion of voters are either moving to Android or opting for older iPhone generations, indicating that the new features and upgrades may not be compelling enough.

2. **Size and Display Concerns**:
   - The **iPhone 16 Pro Max** at 6.9"" is considered too large by 15% of voters. Although it offers advanced features, the sheer size is a deterrent for many.
   - On the other hand, the **iPhone 16 Pro** with its 6.3"" display seems to have hit the right spot in terms of size, but still, many users aren't interested, likely due to other factors like the incremental nature of the upgrades.

3. **Display Refresh Rate**: A critical point of contention is that the standard iPhone 16 models still feature 60Hz displays, which are increasingly viewed as outdated when even budget Android phones offer 120Hz. This could be contributing to the lack of enthusiasm for the vanilla models.

4. **Shift to Alternatives**: A striking finding is that nearly half of the poll participants are considering a move to Android, reflecting a broader dissatisfaction with the new iPhone models. This could signal that competitors are offering more attractive or innovative options at similar or lower price points.

5. **Confusion Around the iPhone 16 Plus**: Although the iPhone 16 Plus saw a significant increase in pre-orders (48% higher than the 15 Plus), its overall appeal remains low. The lack of substantial upgrades beyond new side buttons has left consumers unsure about its value proposition.

6. **Positive Reception of the iPhone 16**: The base iPhone 16 model garnered a decent positive vote (15.1%) and has the highest percentage of people who might purchase after reading reviews. This suggests that while it’s not a runaway hit, there is cautious optimism around this model, especially among those who may not need or want the advanced features of the Pro models.

### Analysis:
- **Apple's Misstep**: The data implies that Apple may have overestimated consumer interest in the iPhone 16 Pro Max, particularly in its size and the incremental upgrades it offers. The company's strategy of pushing larger devices and modestly improving existing features seems to have missed the mark with many users.

- **Consumer Preferences**: There is a growing demand for more practical, innovative features that are not solely tied to device size or slight performance boosts. The strong inclination toward Android alternatives suggests that Apple might need to rethink its approach, especially if it wants to maintain its dominance in the premium smartphone market.

- **Future Implications**: As the holiday season approaches and Apple Intelligence is fully rolled out, there might be a turnaround in sales. However, the early lukewarm reception could indicate a larger trend of consumers seeking more value-driven or feature-rich alternatives, potentially affecting Apple's market share in the long run.

Hi folks — I am the design and photo half of the team of 2 ~~dudes~~ fresh dads that make [Halide](http://halide.cam/download), a camera for iPhone.

tldr: we made a way to take photos with zero AI stuff and without almost any iPhone processing.

A lot of people started using our apps in the last years to get less processing on their shots. Processing is the thing that makes iPhone photos great or terrible depending on who you ask — it can do a lot of magical things in the blink of a second, like merging a dozen photos together to give you detail in shadows, highlights and dogs and cats and people. AI comes in and cuts out parts of the shot so they can be edited a bit differently. It lets you do stuff like portrait mode, or night mode!

It also sometimes is what makes you puzzled when you take a photo and it comes out looking WAY different than what you thought it would.

The reason is simple: because lots of ‘computational magic’ is done in processing to get nice shots out of very, very tiny lenses and sensors, the results always have some creative decisions baked in. And you might agree or... well, disagree with those.

I always felt like it would be ideal if you could just choose — maybe even per shot! — if you wanted this or not.

**That’s why we made this update.** It’s been a few years in the works (4, if we’re counting) - but new apps, new iPhones, and two babies later and here it is.

Halide 2.15 lets you pick between Apple’s default camera processing, reduced processing, or Process Zero. The last is new, and shiny, and basically does a zero-AI, minimal process on raw sensor data from one shot to get a nice, film-like shot.

Note that it’s not \*better\*(\*): it’s really just, well, different. You can choose if you want it or not. Expect contrasty shots; grain; some imperfections that processing removes. At night, it might get very noisy! But I found it really fun to ‘relearn’ my love for photography without the help of the computational stuff.

(\* it’s better if you liked the results more. that’s the fun part!!)

Now, the other part to this is that I’m... not the biggest fan of the AI wave that is hitting all sorts of creative arts. I think AI is great for doing the things that I hate doing. I want it to do my bookkeeping and organize my stuff. But increasingly, I see photos being made meaningless through generative AI and more products that replace the wonders of a creative process. I think, as companies making creative tools, we should take more of a stand to make tools for creation and putting control in the artists’ hands rather than try to replace them. And this is a small step towards that.

Anyway, our update[ is out now](https://www.lux.camera/introducing-process-zero-for-iphone/) with a 1 week free trial — and I wanted to answer some questions on iPhone cameras / photography, the update, and more as well as hand out some promo codes. I usually drop into the thread a few times throughout the day and just give ‘em out, but this time I also have some for our video app Kino and our other lil cam Spectre!

Edit: I wanted to add to this — I know we’ve added tons of features that mostly targeted both Pro and the latest and greatest phones, but we went through a lot of work to ensure that this is on just about any iPhone we can support — going back to iPhone 8 and iPhone X. It’ll even make your old shots you took with Halide better if you shot in RAW with our new process!

Drop a comment and I’ll DM you a code as long as we got some!

And if you already enjoy the app and take photos with it, stay tuned for a fun Process Zero contest we’re doing next week.

edit: gonna step out for a quick lunch but back after to send out some more codes!

edit 2: whoa folks, thanks for the amazing response. I’ll send out what I can and then switch over to sending out some codes for our other apps :)

edit 3\_final: ok folks, thank you for the fantastic response - I sent out all I could, but we’ll be back come new iPhone season!",1219,1501

As someone who spends a lot of time writing on every Apple device, I’ve run out of patience for the low quality spelling correction on macOS, iPadOS, and iOS. The slightest misspelling and Apple has no idea what word I am trying to write. Speed is important to me, and using the technology in front of me to speed up my writing is what I expect. Every time I have a mispelled word that Apple can‘t correct or offer any accurate suggestion for, I can copy and paste that misspelling into Google and get the correct spelling of the correct intended word. 100% of the time. To me, this is one of the most basic and useful examples of AI assisting a user, and Apple’s current offering is dreadful. There is hope with Apple Intelligence coming, but I’ve yet to see this example shown. If Apple Intelligence lands without serious improvement in this area, I will lose a lot of faith in what Apple is doing. ",948,250

Hey everyone, I’m the creator of **Penbook**, a notebook app for iPad (and iPhone!) that’s perfect for anyone who loves writing, drawing, or organizing their thoughts with the Apple Pencil. And we just released an update with our **2025 Planner** book.

Unlike most note-taking apps, Penbook has a unique superpower: among its 100+ page templates (including classics like grid and ruled), you'll also find **calendar pages** like daily, weekly, monthly and yearly. And these are not your tired PDF calendars:

📆 The pages show your **ACTUAL** calendar events.  
👫 If you have **shared calendars**, you'll see those too.  
🤖 Your calendar pages **update automatically** when you add to your iOS calendar  
💪 They're **super powerful**: portrait or landscape, iPhone or iPad sized, any date and date span.

There is no better way to plan and organize your time than with Penbook and Pencil. And the **2025 Planner** makes this super easy.

**What else can it do?**

📝 Create **unlimited notebooks**, each with customizable paper types (lined, grid, music sheets, chemistry papers, and more).  
🔖 **Bookmark and annotate** your pages with notes and titles, making it super easy to jump between pages or books.  
📖 **Organize** your ideas effortlessly with images, text notes, shapes, and more.  
📄 And if you do want to share a **PDF** (or import one), we got that too.

Penbook Lifetime is usually $49.99 on the App Store, but **today it’s completely free!** 🎉

No catches—just download it and see if it sparks joy for you. If you do grab it, I’d love to hear your feedback or see how you’re using it! ❤️

In a lot of the online chatter, I see folks poking fun at Apple for calling the iPhone 5c ""unapologetically plastic,"" like Apple is trying to spin plastic as some kind of high-end material (for example, Linus from LTT mocked Apple for it in one of the Wan show episodes right after Apple launched M1). While it’s true that this is something Apple loves to do, but I think in this particular case, there's a misunderstanding here about what Apple was really getting at.

Let me first introduce some context, the year is 2013, and a lot of phone manufacturers use plastic in their flagship products, for example, Samsung, with their Galaxy S5. The S5 has a full plastic build, it uses plastic frame and plastic back plate. However they slapped metallic paint on the frame and added fake leather textures on the back. Why? It seems like they're a bit embarrassed to just embrace the plastic—they feel the need to dress it up as something more 'premium.' Leather and aluminum are more premium than plastic, thus the disguising. (It’s a design choice, I’m not judging it. In fact I own a S5 and a Note 4. But my point is valid.) In Apple or Jony Ive’s book, these people are being “apologetic” for their use of plastic.

Apple took a different approach with the iPhone 5c. When they said ""unapologetic plastic,"" they meant that they're not trying to disguise the material with tricks. Instead, they're embracing it head-on—highlighting the aesthetic and functional benefits of plastic without pretending it's something it's not. If you check out the design video Apple released for the 5c, it's pretty clear. They're not justifying a premium price by claiming the material is something revolutionary; they're just showcasing plastic, pure and simple.",789,158

I stumbled upon this old clip of Steve Ballmer, the ex-CEO of Microsoft, commented on the 1st iPhone right after its 2007 launch. 

Interviewer: What was your first reaction when you saw the iPhone?

Steve: LOL ...most expensive phone in the world and doesn't appeal to business customers because it doesn't have a keyboard...

Frankly, his perspective made a lot of sense. Let’s rewind to 2007: fully touchscreen phones made up less than 1% of mobile phone sales. Everyone was content with keyboard phones—they were faster and more accurate for texting and dialing. A phone with just a touchscreen and no physical keyboard? It seemed crazy and undesirable to almost everyone.

For Apple to build an entirely touch-based phone was seen nearly as a reckless gamble. Imagine trying to pitch this idea back then to investors, shareholders, or company executives, who would rightfully ask, “What’s the unique selling point (USP) here?” Back then, even Steve Jobs would've had hard time convincing people, but luckily, he didn't need to persuade many people to move forward with his vision. As Steve Ballmer’s reaction highlights, the idea was far from universally understood--at least until the iPhone’s sales numbers started to roll in.

Perhaps USP isn't just about having a killer idea that wows everyone immediately. Sometimes, it's about a novel concept that starts with a small group of believers and is brought to life through relentless and meticulous execution. Steve Ballmer couldn’t pull it off—but fortunately the other Steve did.",749,344

I thought I'd give it a shot, but the notification summaries that AI came up with have absolutely *nothing* to do with the actual content of the messages.  

This'll take years to smooth out.  I'm not holding my breath for this under-developed technology that Apple has over-hyped.  Their marketing for Apple Intelligence is way over the top, trying to make it look like it's the best thing since sliced bread, when it's only in its infancy.",648,248

Hi everyone! I'd like to share a bit of my story and show my very first app I launched last week.

I’m a web developer at my day job. Been doing it for almost 15 years, and while I mostly enjoy webdev, I’ve always been an Apple fan and for a big chunk of my career I was watching from the sidelines at all the awesome stuff happening in the Apple dev community.

At some point, I even started to feel a bit like an impostor tbh: watching WWDC sessions, following Swift news but doing nothing to actually apply all of this in practice. Why even waste time on this instead of improving the skills that pay bills?

I made a few attempts to build an iOS app over the years, but it never went anywhere. Retrospectively, I understood that those projects were too ambitious for a single person to build, and I could not sustain motivation.

So last year I decided to build something with a more reasonable scope. On paper, it was a simple habit-tracking app that uses calendar grids (GitHub-style, if you're a developer). Over time, of course, the scope grew, it was not that simple anymore and it took me 9 months to design and build the first version.

The app's name is Checker. You can now [download it on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6502667826).

If you decide to try it out, feel free to reach out with any feedback you might have. I have a ton of features planned for the app and feel excited to finally have something to contribute to the community.

Have a great Sunday everyone!

  
PS. Sorry if you've seen this post already, it got removed last week after an hour or so.",648,221

Hi everyone,  


I've tracked my calories and macros off and on for years, and always felt that the existing solutions were bloated and clunky to use. Since food tracking is something you do multiple times a day, every day, I sought out to build something that made tracking a bit less of a pain in the butt.

A few things that make FitBee stand out:

* **Fast, lightweight and to the point** - The app is just about tracking your nutrition and makes that front and center. I've tried to make things that you do often as simple as possible (e.g., log yesterday's breakfast).

* **Free barcode scanning** - Not much to say here except that it's free and works great! 

* **Photo Logging** - You can take a photo of a food and get an estimate of the calories and macros. It's not 100% accurate but it's been super helpful for me when eating at a restaurant that doesn't have published nutrition info.

* **Accurate nutrition data** - The nutrition data is sourced from the USDA dataset and nutrition labels off the packages. I also spent effort adding east asian foods (e.g. things you get at 99 Ranch or Weee) to the database, since those were hard to find/track in other apps I've tried.

* **Recipe importing** - You can pretty much point any recipe at the app and it'll import the ingredients and generate nutrition information for you. As I got more into fitness, I started to cook more so this has been super helpful.

* **Robust Apple Health support** - You can sync data with Apple Health. I wear an Apple Watch so it's great for getting the energy burned through exercises.

* **No Ads, Sign in with Apple** - Uses Sign in with Apple to protect your privacy. No ads.

* **Premium Features** - FitBee offers a subset of features behind a monthly subscription. These include setting macronutrient goals, unlimited photo logging and unlimited recipe imports by URL.

You can try FitBee here:  [https://apple.co/4aGUw5X](https://apple.co/4aGUw5X)

If you end up trying it, I'd love any feedback!

Please note that FitBee is currently available in the US, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand. I'm hoping to add more countries soon!

EDIT 07/28/2024:

Oh boy 😅 

It seems like the fact that FitBee has a subscription really struck a nerve with folks, and I guess I shouldn't be surprised. I've updated the description to include the fact that there is indeed a subscription for specific features. I do believe the point about making data export be a premium feature not being great is valid, and I will definitely reconsider that in a future update.

EDIT 07/31/2024:

I just released an update (2.8) which makes Apple Health export available to everyone. I never had the intention of ""locking in"" your data, so this should be more consistent with that. 

Thanks to everyone who has given a FitBee a try already!",432,207

Hi Apple enjoyers!

I want to introduce to you our first fully free and ad-less IOS app. We work on it for 5 months without any external budget and we need your support and feedback!  
Our app should help you control your expenses and see detailed and convenient statistics on where your money goes.  
We are so proud that we implemented the next good features that others provide only with subscriptions:

1. With our advanced statistics, you will always know where your money goes and where it comes from. Discover which expenses take up the most of your budget and which income source is the most profitable. You can also export this data in PDF format to share with tax authorities or business partners.
2. Collaborative Budget Management: Managing a family or team budget becomes easier with Money Bee. Share access to wallets via QR code and keep a real-time joint record of expenses and income.
3. Multi-Wallets for Various Needs: Create multiple wallets for different purposes. Each wallet allows you to manage its own categories and transactions, making your financial management more flexible and effective.
4. Quick Start with Data Import: Import transaction data from other sources for an instant start. You can import your data in CSV format which means you can export your data from other apps and import it to our. Currently, it was tested only with other popular budget trackers but we plan to extend this functionality and allow people to configure our app to understand their own CSV format.

Please, feel free to write any feedback about our idea/app functionality/design/anything else!
