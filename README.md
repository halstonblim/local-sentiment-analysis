# ðŸ§  Reddit Brand Sentiment Monitor

This project tracks Reddit sentiment over time for specific subreddits or brands, starting with `r/apple`. It uses the Reddit API to pull top posts, applies a pre-trained sentiment analysis model, and visualizes sentiment trends. The goal is to eventually detect shifts (drift), build a real-time dashboard, and deploy the tool publicly.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Features (Current Phase)

### âœ… Implemented:
- **Reddit Scraper** using PRAW:
  - Pulls top posts (e.g. top 1000 from the past year)
  - Stores relevant metadata: `created_at`, `retrieved_at`, `title`, `selftext`, `score`, `num_comments`
- **Sentiment Scoring**:
  - Uses Hugging Face model [`distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english)
  - Calculates average sentiment score per post and visualizes monthly trends

## ðŸ“Š Example Output

Below is a sample output showing sentiment trend in `r/apple` based on top posts from the past year:

![Sentiment trend chart for r/apple](apple.png)

The x-axis shows each month, and the y-axis is the **average sentiment score** (1 = positive, 0 = negative).
